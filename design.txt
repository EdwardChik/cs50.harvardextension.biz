*** CSCI E-50: LearnIt

The design of LearnIt was based on what we learned about PHP in class, and then trying to take it further by orienting it towards a more user input driven experience. I liked the idea of building something that I could relate to, having studied 50+ hours per quiz and wishing there had been an easier way to do so.

I created a database schema based on what is known as a 3NF process, which I came across online from a database design tutorial. I focused on creating as little redundancy as possible, while still providing each table with a unique ID that could be used as a primary key.
