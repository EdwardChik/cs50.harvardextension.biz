*** CSCI E-50: LearnIt

The concept behind CS50 LearnIt was to build a program that helps students study for CS50's quizzes. I wanted to built a page that will organize previous CS50 quizzes into paired questions and answers, allowing students to study by entering answers and then comparing to the correct answers provided by the teaching staff.

The project is written in PHP so it won't require compilation, and there's an included .sql export which can also be loaded into a local installation of phpMyAdmin or a compatible equivalent to access the data set. I loaded in some of the questions from the past couple of quizzes, the conversion from PDF to text was so difficult (i.e. inconsistent cryptic characters and spacing) that I couldn't add more than a sample.



Process
- Create a database table that stores questions and correct answers
- Create a template that toggles between hiding and showing the correct answers

Challenges
- Populating Database: How to populate the questions and correct answers into the database (can I avoid substantial manual data entry to copy/paste into phpMyAdmin)?

Why It Interests Me
- Future students of CS50 can use this tool! I spent 50+ hours studying for Quiz 0 and will spend at least that much time studying for Quiz 1, having a portal that allows me to easily compare my answers with the correct answers while studying would expedite my studying process.
